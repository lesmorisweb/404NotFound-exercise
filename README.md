## My Process

I started with the HTML structure, then I made de styles to fit the requirements. I did mobile first design, and then, expanded it to desktop design using query params

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learn about some propertis from CSS, like the variables in CSS. Normally in my personal proyects I don't use the querys, so this excercise help me to practice more this topics.
```

In this project we learn hoy to use medua queries and flexbox to desing a responsive mobile-first site.

```css
   @media screen and (min-width: 1440px) {
    body{
        margin: 20px 40px;
    }
    .container {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: row;
      justify-content: center;
      padding: 100px 30px;
    }
```
### Continued development
We need to continue learning about how flexbox works and about responsive desing
